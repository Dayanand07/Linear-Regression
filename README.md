2.Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set

3.Predicting the test result

4.Test accuracy of the result(Creation of Confusion matrix)

5.Visualizing the test set result.

6.Introducing a Dataset

7.RESULT


## Installation
For running this project, Use google colaboratory for analysis and building models.

## Introducing a Dataset
car making company that has recently launched a new SUV car. So the company wanted to check how many users from the dataset, wants to purchase the car


## Data Preparation
In this step, we will pre-process/prepare the data so that we can use it in our code efficiently. It will be the same as we have done in Data pre-processing topic. 

This dataset has 400 observations and 5 features. 

## Result
We can find the accuracy of the predicted result by interpreting the confusion matrix. By above output, we can interpret that 65+24= 89 (Correct Output) and 8+3= 11(Incorrect Output).
